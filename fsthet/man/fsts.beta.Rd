\description{
   Example fst calculations using beta (fst.choice="var") from a genepop file.
   The original data were generated by using a numerical analysis with Nm = 10, 75 demes, and 5 population samples taken. No selection was imposed.
	The fsts were calculated using calc.actual.fst(gpop,fst.choice="var")
   This file contains a dataframe with 2000 columns and 3 rows. The first column is the Locus ID, the second column is the Ht for that locus, and the third column is the Fst for that locus.
