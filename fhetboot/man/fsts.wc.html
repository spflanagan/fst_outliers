<h2>Example fst calculations from a genepop file.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Example fst calculations from a genepop file.
The Fsts were calculated using the Weir and Cockerham (1993) calculation.
The original data were generated by using a numerical analysis with Nm = 10, 75 demes, and 5 population samples taken. No selection was imposed.
The fsts were calculated using calc.actual.fst(gpop)
This file contains a dataframe with 2000 columns and 3 rows. The first column is the Locus ID, the second column is the Ht for that locus, and the third column is the Fst for that locus.
